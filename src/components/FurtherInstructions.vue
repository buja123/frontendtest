    <h3>We have decided that we are in need for a live weather webapp</h3>
    <br>
    <p>We want to be able to see <b>Cape Town</b>, <b>Johannesburg</b> and <b>Durban</b> in a list and be able to click through to them and view a 7 day forecast</p>
    <br>

    <p>We had a developers spec meeting and these are the mockups that we want you to implement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Location list:

      </li>
      <li>
        Location Forecast: 

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We want you to consume the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Openweathermap API</a> to retrieve the live data using the following API key:<strong> c60affe7bd71ca5cf3853f5a6fba4dbb</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Look through the documentation to find the calls you need</strong></p>
